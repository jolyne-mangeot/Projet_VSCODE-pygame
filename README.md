# Projet_VSCODE-pygame

This template provides a clear and modular structure for managing different scenes in a Pygame game. Instead of having multiple game loops, it relies on a state system, where each screen (menu, game, pause, etc.) is a distinct class that integrates into a single main loop.

Sets up script architecture, offering an organized starting point that can be adapted to any game requiring multiple screens.

Based on script posted by *metulburr* on the [python forum](https://python-forum.io/thread-336-post-103792.html#pid103792)
